# Harmony Interop DLLs

This is a collection of DLLs usable with BepInEx 5.4 to allow running plugins that were
built against older versions of Harmony.

By default, BepInEx 5.4 includes interop DLL only for HarmonyX 2.0/Harmony 2.0-beta support.  
The additional DLLs in this repository allow to support older Harmony versions.

## How to use

**If you are not a developer, these DLLs are not for you!**

1. Download interop DLLs for Harmony versions you need from releases.
2. Put the downloaded DLLs into `BepInEx/core` folder.
