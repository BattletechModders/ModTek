# Developing ModTek

ModTek itself is based on the best practices found in the [Development Guide](DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md).

The ModTekPreloader is the a special piece of software, as it downloads and integrates UnitDoorstop into the release build.
It also cannot use any functionality found in BattleTech itself, as it bootstrap the game before it is being loaded.

Just use standard GitHub practices in creating a fork and creating a merge request to get your additions into ModTek.
